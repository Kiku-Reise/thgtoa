Anonymous Donations to support this project are welcome (I'm definitely not a tech billionaire/millionaire and my budget is actually quite limited).

My current goal is to get enough to buy a Domain Name and VPS to self-host this project.

Since this is about anonymity, I will only accept crypto donations using Monero donations to this address:

You can get Monero coins on any of those Exchanges: <https://www.getmonero.org/community/merchants/#exchanges> (The well-known ones are a Binance, Bitfinex, Poloniex and Kraken).

**Thank you for any contribution if any. All donations will be mentioned within this file without mentioning their origin/details.**
